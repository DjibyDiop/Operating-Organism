# Operating-Organism (OO)

> **Experimental bare-metal AI OS** — A self-evolving cognitive system running without any operating system.  
> By [Djiby Diop](https://github.com/Djiby-diop)

## Vision

**Operating-Organism** is a research-grade bare-metal system that combines:

- **UEFI x86_64 kernel** — boots directly from USB/EFI, no OS layer
- **LLM inference engine** — llama2/Mamba SSM running on raw silicon
- **15+ bio-inspired organ modules** — memory zones, neural pathways, immune warden
- **D+ policy engine** — decision-making with safety constraints
- **Federated intelligence** — multi-node learning via bare-metal network
- **TLS oracle layer** — direct HTTPS calls to GPT-4/Claude/Gemini (no proxy)
- **LoRA self-improvement** — the system can improve its own weights at runtime

> The goal: an OS that thinks, learns, and evolves — without Linux, without libc, without compromise.

## Public release readiness

Before making this repository public, run the documented release gates:

- Playbook (EN + FR): [docs/PUBLIC_RELEASE_PLAYBOOK.md](docs/PUBLIC_RELEASE_PLAYBOOK.md)
- Third-party license audit template: [docs/THIRD_PARTY_LICENSE_AUDIT.md](docs/THIRD_PARTY_LICENSE_AUDIT.md)
- Translation policy (EN + FR + others): [docs/TRANSLATIONS.md](docs/TRANSLATIONS.md)
- Automated preflight script: `./scripts/public-preflight.ps1`

## Architectural role

`llm-baremetal` is the **sovereign runtime** of the larger Operating Organism vision.
It is meant to be preserved and evolved as the bare-metal / survival / recovery pillar of the system, not replaced.

## OO-SomaMind V1 integration

The current `OO-SomaMind V1` runtime contract is:

- `MAMB` = executable bare-metal backbone format
- `OOSS` = future OO sidecar / enriched extension format

Current runtime skeleton commands:

- `/core_load <file.mamb>`
- `/mind_diag`
- `/mind_halt_probe [loop_pos]`
- `/mind_halt_decide [loop_pos] [threshold]`
- `/mind_halt_sweep [start] [end] [step] [threshold]`
- `/mind_halt_policy [threshold] [on|off]`
- `/mind_halt_policy_save`
- `/mind_halt_policy_load`
- `/mind_halt_policy_apply_saved`
- `/mind_halt_policy_apply_saved_if_needed`
- `/mind_halt_policy_sync`
- `/mind_halt_policy_sync_force`
- `/mind_halt_policy_audit`
- `/mind_audit`
- `/mind_doctor`
- `/mind_next`
- `/mind_snapshot`
- `/mind_ready`
- `/mind_bootstrap_v1`
- `/mind_path_v1`
- `/mind_halt_policy_reset`
- `/mind_halt_policy_diff`
- `/oo_sidecar <file.ooss>`
- `/oo_sidecar_audit`
- `/oo_sidecar_unload`
- `/attach_load <file>`
- `/attach_audit`
- `/attach_policy [status|audit|diff|sync|sync_force|reset [route]|<route> <temp> <top_p> <rep> <max_tokens>]`
- `/attach_policy_audit`
- `/attach_policy_diff`
- `/attach_policy_sync`
- `/attach_policy_sync_force`
- `/attach_unload`
- `/mind_status`

Current sidecar behavior:

- validates a minimal `OOSS` header
- keeps the validated sidecar blob resident in memory
- exposes a first `HaltingHead` hook when the exported layout matches the expected V1 sidecar layout
- validates an attach request on `/attach_load` by opening the file and checking a readable `GGUF` summary or a sane legacy `.bin` header before marking it active
- lets an active validated attach influence `SomaMind` routing as the external battery, and injects compact advisory attach context into `/ssm_infer` when the selected route is `EXTERNAL` or `DUAL`
- applies transient attach-route sampling caps during `/ssm_infer` for `EXTERNAL` or `DUAL` routes (temperature/top_p/repetition/max_tokens), then restores the route-tuned base values after generation
- exposes `/oo_sidecar_audit` to summarize sidecar residency, header validity, halting-hook readiness, and suggested next action
- exposes `/attach_audit` to summarize attached-model registration, validation/backend status, relation to core, and suggested next action
- can now early-stop active decode loops at runtime when `halt_prob >= threshold`
- exposes a configurable runtime halt policy via `/mind_halt_policy`
- separates runtime changes from disk persistence with `/mind_halt_policy_save` and `/mind_halt_policy_load`
- can re-apply the saved `repl.cfg` policy as the runtime source of truth via `/mind_halt_policy_apply_saved`
- can skip unnecessary saved-policy re-application via `/mind_halt_policy_apply_saved_if_needed` when runtime is already in sync
- exposes `/mind_halt_policy_sync` as a simpler semantic alias for syncing runtime from `repl.cfg` only when needed
- exposes `/mind_halt_policy_sync_force` to reload runtime from `repl.cfg` even when it is already in sync
- exposes `/mind_halt_policy_audit` to summarize runtime policy, persisted policy, sync state, and last apply/sync effect
- exposes `/mind_audit` to aggregate halt-policy, attach-policy, sidecar, and attach audits into one global runtime report, then append normalized readiness and next-action fields
- exposes `/mind_doctor` to split the next safe corrective sequence into auto-fixable actions vs manual follow-up from current runtime state, then emit normalized `next_action` and `next_reason`
- exposes `/mind_next` to print exactly one best next action from current runtime state
- exposes `/mind_snapshot` to print a compact stable key=value machine-readable runtime snapshot (`format=kv-v1`, schema `llmk-mind-snapshot-v5`, fixed field order), including attach kind/format/validation fields plus EXTERNAL/DUAL attach policy config, preview, and persisted sync fields, plus `/mind_snapshot strict` for headerless script-friendly output
- exposes `/soma_status` and `/soma_route` to preview the attach-driven EXTERNAL/DUAL policy caps before generation
- exposes `/attach_policy` to inspect, audit, diff, sync, reset, or override the runtime attach policy profiles used by EXTERNAL and DUAL routes, best-effort persists overrides into `repl.cfg` so they reload at boot, and reports persisted-vs-runtime sync in `status`
- exposes `/attach_policy_audit`, `/attach_policy_diff`, `/attach_policy_sync`, and `/attach_policy_sync_force` as direct aliases for the persisted attach-policy control plane
- exposes `/mind_ready` as a short binary readiness check for the V1 runtime path, now with the same recommended next action used by `/mind_next`
- exposes `/mind_bootstrap_v1` to auto-apply the obvious safe V1 bootstrap steps, including reusing stored core/sidecar/attach requests when available, and then report normalized `next_action` and `next_reason`
- exposes `/mind_path_v1` to print the shortest recommended V1 startup sequence from the current runtime state, including `/mind_bootstrap_v1` when it is the best shortcut, then emit normalized `next_action` and `next_reason`
- stores persisted values in `repl.cfg` via `mind_halt_enabled` and `mind_halt_threshold`
- stores attach policy persistence in `repl.cfg` via `attach_policy_external_*` and `attach_policy_dual_*`
- can restore runtime V1 halt defaults via `/mind_halt_policy_reset`
- shows whether runtime halt policy is in sync with `repl.cfg` in `/mind_status`
- shows whether runtime attach policy is in sync with `repl.cfg` in `/mind_status`
- shows the mode and effect of the latest apply/sync action in `/mind_status`
- shows the mode and effect of the latest attach-policy sync/apply action in `/mind_status`
- shows normalized readiness fields plus `next_action` and `next_reason` in `/mind_status`
- can print explicit runtime vs persisted halt deltas with `/mind_halt_policy_diff`
- can print explicit runtime vs persisted attach-policy deltas with `/attach_policy_diff`
- does not yet execute broader sidecar semantics (budgets, tool metadata, richer OO policies)

## Build (Windows + WSL)

### Model weights (not in git)

Model weights (`.gguf` / legacy `.bin`) are intentionally not tracked in git.
Download them from Hugging Face (or any direct URL) into `models/`.

Windows:

```powershell
./scripts/get-weights.ps1 -Url "https://huggingface.co/<org>/<repo>/resolve/main/<file>.gguf" -OutName "<file>.gguf"
```

Stable public test models for this project are also published at [djibydiop/llm-baremetal](https://huggingface.co/djibydiop/llm-baremetal). To fetch one directly into `models/`:

```powershell
./scripts/get-stable-model.ps1 -File stories15M.q8_0.gguf

# example for the larger legacy llama2.c export
./scripts/get-stable-model.ps1 -File stories110M.bin
```

Linux:

```bash
./scripts/get-weights.sh "https://huggingface.co/<org>/<repo>/resolve/main/<file>.gguf" "<file>.gguf"
```

Then pass the model path to the build.

1) Ensure `tokenizer.bin` is present (this repo includes it by default).
2) Download a model file into `models/` (see above).
   - Supported today for inference: `.bin` (llama2.c export)
   - Supported today for inference: `.gguf` (F16/F32 + common quant types like Q4/Q5/Q8; see below)
   - You can also use a base name without extension (the image builder will copy `.bin` and/or `.gguf` if present)
3) Build + create boot image:

```powershell
./build.ps1
```

Example (base name):

```powershell
./build.ps1 -ModelBin models/stories110M

# or explicit file
./build.ps1 -ModelBin models/my-model.gguf
```

## Build (Linux)

Prereqs (Ubuntu/Debian):

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential gnu-efi mtools parted dosfstools grub-pc-bin
```

Then:

```bash
cd llm-baremetal
make clean
make repl

# Build an image with a bundled model:
# MODEL=stories110M ./create-boot-mtools.sh

# Or build a small image without embedding weights (copy your model later):
NO_MODEL=1 ./create-boot-mtools.sh
```

## Prebuilt image (x86_64)

GitHub Releases provides a prebuilt **x86_64 no-model** boot image.
It intentionally does **not** bundle any model weights, and it does **not** hardcode a model path.

Download these assets from the latest Release:

- `llm-baremetal-boot-nomodel-x86_64.img.xz`
- `SHA256SUMS.txt`

Verify + extract (Linux):

```bash
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt
xz -d llm-baremetal-boot-nomodel-x86_64.img.xz
```

Flash to a USB drive (Linux, replace `/dev/sdX`):

```bash
sudo dd if=llm-baremetal-boot-nomodel-x86_64.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M conv=fsync status=progress
```

Copy your model to the USB EFI/FAT partition:

- Copy your model file (`.gguf` or legacy `.bin`) to the root of the FAT partition (or create a `models/` folder and put it there).
- `tokenizer.bin` is already included in the Release image.

Note: some UEFI FAT drivers can be unreliable with long filenames. If you hit "file not found / open failed" issues, prefer an 8.3-compatible filename (e.g. `STORIES11.GGU`) or use the FAT 8.3 alias (e.g. `STORIE~1.GGU`) when setting `model=` in `repl.cfg`.

Boot the USB on an x86_64 UEFI machine, then select/load your model from the REPL.

## Recommended conversational setup (8GB RAM)

On an 8GB machine, "conversational" works best with a **small instruct/chat GGUF model** rather than a large 7B model.

Recommended target:

- Size: ~0.5B-1B parameters
- Format: `.gguf`
- Quantization: `Q4_0/Q4_1/Q5_0/Q5_1/Q8_0` (scalar path) and `Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K` (dequant via gguf_kquant)

Suggested first-run settings:

- Keep context small at first (e.g. 256-512) to avoid running out of RAM (KV cache grows with context).
- If your model is Q8_0 and you want lower RAM usage, enable `gguf_q8_blob=1` (default in the Release image).

Useful REPL commands:

- `/diag` to inspect GOP, RAM, CPU features, and detected model paths
- `/diag_report` to save the same diagnostic view plus model inventory to `llmk-diag.txt`
- `/models` to list `.gguf`/`.bin` found in the root and `models\\`
- `/model_info <file>` to inspect a model before loading, including files in root, `models\\`, and FAT 8.3-resolved names
- `/oo_status` to inspect runtime engine state plus persistence/continuity artifacts (`OOSTATE.BIN`, `OORECOV.BIN`, `OOJOUR.LOG`, `OOCONSULT.LOG`, `OOHANDOFF.TXT`)
- `/oo_outcome` to inspect `OOOUTCOME.LOG`, pending next-boot checks, and confirmed adaptation outcomes
- `/oo_explain` to explain the latest consult decision, with `/oo_explain verbose` for confidence/plan/dynamics details and `/oo_explain boot` for latest confirmed boot comparison plus recent confirmed history
- `/oo_reboot_probe` to arm a reboot continuity check, reboot, then verify that OO state came back aligned on the next boot
- `/cfg` to confirm effective `repl.cfg` settings

Recent OO consult builds also expose higher-level operator fields in `/oo_status`, `/oo_log`, and `/oo_explain verbose`, including:

- `last.consult.boot_relation` / `boot_bias`
- `last.consult.trend` / `trend_bias`
- `last.consult.saturation` / `saturation_bias`
- `last.consult.operator_summary`

This makes it easier to see cases such as `positive_but_saturated`, where a previously successful action is still favored by history but is no longer directly applicable because the target is already at its bound.

For a first real-machine no-model check, the image also ships with [llmk-autorun-real-hw-oo-smoke.txt](llmk-autorun-real-hw-oo-smoke.txt). Run it with `/autorun llmk-autorun-real-hw-oo-smoke.txt` or point `autorun_file` to it in `repl.cfg`.

For a real-machine reboot continuity check, the image also ships with [llmk-autorun-real-hw-oo-reboot-smoke.txt](llmk-autorun-real-hw-oo-reboot-smoke.txt). Run it with `/autorun llmk-autorun-real-hw-oo-reboot-smoke.txt`; the first `/oo_reboot_probe` arms the check and reboots, then the next boot verifies continuity and continues the script.

### Flashing from Windows

- Use Rufus: select the `.img` (or extract from `.img.xz` first), partition scheme **GPT**, target **UEFI (non CSM)**.

## Run (QEMU)

```powershell
./run.ps1 -Preflight -Gui
```

Host -> sovereign handoff smoke:

```powershell
./test-qemu-handoff.ps1

# optional if oo-host is not in the default sibling path
./test-qemu-handoff.ps1 -OoHostRoot ..\oo-host
```

This smoke flow also extracts OOHANDOFF.TXT beside the repo so [oo-host/sync-check](../oo-host/README.md) can verify the aligned host/export/receipt state.

Model-backed OO consult smoke in QEMU:

```powershell
./test-qemu-autorun.ps1 -Mode oo_consult_smoke -ModelBin stories15M.q8_0.gguf -SkipPrebuild
```

This validates `/oo_consult`, `/oo_log`, and `OOCONSULT.LOG` creation with a small bundled model before moving to real hardware.

No-model OO outcome / adaptation learning smoke in QEMU:

```powershell
./test-qemu-autorun.ps1 -Mode oo_outcome_smoke -Accel tcg -SkipPrebuild
```

This validates the consult -> persist -> reboot-verified outcome -> learned reselection loop, including `/oo_outcome`, `/oo_explain boot`, recent confirmed history, and operator-facing summaries persisted in `OOCONSULT.LOG`.

For faster iteration, use the unified QEMU wrapper [run-qemu-oo-validation.ps1](run-qemu-oo-validation.ps1):

```powershell
# run one focused lane
./run-qemu-oo-validation.ps1 -Mode consult -ModelBin stories15M.q8_0.gguf -Accel tcg -SkipPrebuild
./run-qemu-oo-validation.ps1 -Mode reboot -Accel tcg
./run-qemu-oo-validation.ps1 -Mode handoff -Accel tcg

# or run the core QEMU matrix end to end
./run-qemu-oo-validation.ps1 -Mode all-core -ModelBin stories15M.q8_0.gguf -Accel tcg -SkipPrebuild
```

The wrapper keeps QEMU as the primary iteration loop for no-model smoke, reboot continuity, host -> sovereign handoff, and model-backed OO consult so hardware reboots are reserved for larger milestones only.

For a real UEFI/USB handoff check, copy `sovereign_export.json` from the host runtime onto the FAT root of the USB image, then run [llmk-autorun-real-hw-handoff-smoke.txt](llmk-autorun-real-hw-handoff-smoke.txt) with `/autorun llmk-autorun-real-hw-handoff-smoke.txt`.

To stage that file from the sibling host workspace, use [llm-baremetal/prepare-real-hw-handoff.ps1](prepare-real-hw-handoff.ps1). It refreshes `oo-host/data/sovereign_export.json`, can copy both the export and the real-hardware handoff autorun script onto a mounted FAT/USB root, and can also build a dedicated `llm-baremetal-boot-real-hw-handoff.img` image with the export already injected.

For the next milestone — model-backed sovereign chat on a real machine — use [prepare-real-hw-chat.ps1](prepare-real-hw-chat.ps1). It generates a dedicated `llm-baremetal-boot-real-hw-chat.img` with a bundled model, a generated `repl.cfg`, and conversational defaults already set:

```powershell
./prepare-real-hw-chat.ps1 -ModelBin stories110M.bin

# optional: boot straight into a tiny chat smoke
./prepare-real-hw-chat.ps1 -ModelBin stories110M.bin -AutoSmoke
```

The helper keeps the image interactive by default. With `-AutoSmoke`, it points `autorun_file` at [llmk-autorun-real-hw-model-chat-smoke.txt](llmk-autorun-real-hw-model-chat-smoke.txt) so the machine can prove model load + first response automatically.

To continue the OO path with a real model, the same helper also supports `-AutoOoConsultSmoke`. That enables `oo_enable=1`, `oo_llm_consult=1`, and boots into [llmk-autorun-real-hw-oo-consult-smoke.txt](llmk-autorun-real-hw-oo-consult-smoke.txt) to prove model-backed `/oo_consult` plus `OOCONSULT.LOG` creation:

```powershell
./prepare-real-hw-chat.ps1 -ModelBin stories110M.bin -AutoOoConsultSmoke
```

For an interactive real-hardware OO image without autorun or auto-shutdown, use `-EnableOoConsult` instead. This keeps the boot in the REPL while pre-enabling `oo_enable=1` and `oo_llm_consult=1`:

```powershell
./prepare-real-hw-chat.ps1 -ModelBin stories110M.bin -EnableOoConsult -OutImagePath ..\llm-baremetal-boot-real-hw-oo-consult-interactive.img
```

Validated demo image:

```powershell
./prepare-real-hw-chat.ps1 -ModelBin stories110M.bin -EnableOoConsult -SkipPrebuild -CtxLen 256 -MaxTokens 96 -Temperature 0.75 -TopP 0.95 -TopK 80 -RepeatPenalty 1.15 -OutImagePath ..\llm-baremetal-boot-demo-stories110M.img
```

This produces a clean interactive USB/demo image with the bundled `stories110M.bin` model, conversational defaults, OO consult enabled, and no autorun shutdown path. After boot, a short live demo can be:

- `/cfg`
- `/diag`
- `hi`
- `/oo_status`
- `/oo_consult`
- `/oo_explain`

Published demo artifacts on Hugging Face now include both the raw and compressed forms:

- `llm-baremetal-boot-demo-stories110M.img`
- `llm-baremetal-boot-demo-stories110M.img.xz`
- `SHA256SUMS-demo-stories110M.txt`
- `SHA256SUMS-demo-stories110M-xz.txt`

After the real-machine run, collect the produced OO artifacts from the mounted FAT partition or from an image copy with [collect-real-hw-oo-artifacts.ps1](collect-real-hw-oo-artifacts.ps1):

```powershell
./collect-real-hw-oo-artifacts.ps1 -UsbRoot E:\

# or directly from an image file
./collect-real-hw-oo-artifacts.ps1 -ImagePath .\llm-baremetal-boot-real-hw-chat.img
```

It gathers `OOCONSULT.LOG`, `OOJOUR.LOG`, `OOSTATE.BIN`, `OORECOV.BIN`, `OOHANDOFF.TXT`, and `llmk-diag.txt` into a timestamped folder under `artifacts/` and writes a small summary file for review.

Then validate the collected folder with [validate-real-hw-oo-artifacts.ps1](validate-real-hw-oo-artifacts.ps1):

```powershell
./validate-real-hw-oo-artifacts.ps1

# explicit folder also works
./validate-real-hw-oo-artifacts.ps1 -ArtifactsDir .\artifacts\real-hw-oo-20260316-012323
```

By default it expects `OOSTATE.BIN`, `OORECOV.BIN`, `OOJOUR.LOG`, and a consult trace in `OOCONSULT.LOG`. Optional stricter checks are available with `-RequireDiag` and `-RequireHandoff`.

If you want a single entrypoint for the whole real-machine consult milestone, use [run-real-hw-oo-consult-validation.ps1](run-real-hw-oo-consult-validation.ps1):

```powershell
# phase 1: prepare the real-hardware image
./run-real-hw-oo-consult-validation.ps1 -Phase prepare -ModelBin stories110M.bin

# phase 2: after the physical boot, collect + validate from the mounted USB FAT root
./run-real-hw-oo-consult-validation.ps1 -Phase collect -UsbRoot E:\
```

The `prepare` phase builds the image with `-AutoOoConsultSmoke`; the `collect` phase chains collection plus validation automatically.

For the real-machine host -> sovereign handoff milestone, use [run-real-hw-handoff-validation.ps1](run-real-hw-handoff-validation.ps1):

```powershell
# phase 1: refresh host export + build the dedicated handoff image
./run-real-hw-handoff-validation.ps1 -Phase prepare

# phase 2: after the physical boot, collect + validate from the mounted USB FAT root
./run-real-hw-handoff-validation.ps1 -Phase collect -UsbRoot E:\
```

The `prepare` phase refreshes `oo-host/data/sovereign_export.json` and builds `llm-baremetal-boot-real-hw-handoff.img`; the `collect` phase requires `OOHANDOFF.TXT`, allows a missing consult log, writes a handoff-focused validation report, and runs `oo-bot sync-check` when the sibling [oo-host](../oo-host/README.md) workspace is available.

For the real-machine reboot continuity milestone, use [run-real-hw-oo-reboot-validation.ps1](run-real-hw-oo-reboot-validation.ps1):

```powershell
# phase 1: build the dedicated reboot continuity image
./run-real-hw-oo-reboot-validation.ps1 -Phase prepare

# phase 2: after the physical reboot cycle, collect + validate from the mounted USB FAT root
./run-real-hw-oo-reboot-validation.ps1 -Phase collect -UsbRoot E:\
```

The `prepare` phase builds `llm-baremetal-boot-real-hw-oo-reboot.img` with `oo_enable=1` and the reboot smoke autorun; the firmware also makes a best-effort attempt to set UEFI `BootNext` to the current USB boot entry before resetting so the second boot returns to the USB device more reliably. The `collect` phase requires the `reboot_probe_arm` and `reboot_probe_verified` journal markers, allows a missing consult log, and writes a reboot-focused validation report.

The chained `collect` phase also writes `oo-real-validation-report.md` into the artifact folder so the real-machine milestone has a human-readable receipt with artifact sizes, consult decision, confidence fields, and parsed journal events.

The host runtime lives in the separate `oo-host` repository and is expected by default as a sibling clone beside this repo.

Validate everything (recommended after pulling updates):

```powershell
./validate.ps1

# explicit override also works with a relative sibling path
./validate.ps1 -OoHostRoot ..\oo-host
```

When the sibling [oo-host](../oo-host/README.md) workspace is present, validation also runs the handoff smoke plus `oo-bot sync-check` end to end. Relative `-OoHostRoot` overrides are resolved against the repo root first, so sibling-path invocations stay stable.

## Release candidate

The current release-candidate status is tracked in [RELEASE_CANDIDATE.md](RELEASE_CANDIDATE.md).

## OS-G (Operating System Genesis) — pillar

OS-G is included as a self-contained kernel-governor prototype (Memory Warden + D+ pipeline) under:

- `OS-G (Operating System Genesis)/`

Quick validation (UEFI/QEMU smoke test, prints `RESULT: PASS/FAIL`):

```powershell
./run-osg-smoke.ps1 -Profile release

# or via the main runner
./run.ps1 -OsgSmoke
```

Host-side tests/tools (requires `std` feature):

```powershell
cd 'OS-G (Operating System Genesis)'
cargo test --features std
```

## Notes

- Model weights are intentionally not tracked in git; use GitHub Releases or your own files.
- Optional config: copy `repl.cfg.example` -> `repl.cfg` (not committed) and rebuild.

Optional OO policy gate:

- If a file named `policy.dplus` exists on the FAT root, the firmware treats it as a D+ policy (OS-G style) and gates `/oo*` commands from it.
- Otherwise, it falls back to a simpler legacy file `oo-policy.dplus`.
- If neither file is present, behavior is unchanged.

Example `policy.dplus` (D+ style; deny-by-default; requires `@@LAW` + `@@PROOF`):

```text
