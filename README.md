# OO (Operating Organism)

OO is a survival-first operating organism, not only an operating system.

OO combines a sovereign bare-metal runtime, a host twin, and governed autonomy loops. The target is a long-lived system with explicit survival invariants, persistent memory, audit trails, policy gates, and reproducible build paths.

## Public / Private Boundary

This is the public-facing repository for Operating Organism.

All related implementation repositories, model assets, deployment material, private experiments, and operational workspaces are private unless Djiby Diop explicitly publishes them. Public visibility of this repository does not make the broader project public.

## What OO Is
- A long-lived organism with goals, memory, modes, policies, and recovery paths.
- A bare-metal-first runtime with host-side observation and orchestration.
- A governed autonomy system where survival invariants are evaluated before objectives.
- A workspace that separates core runtime, optional support lanes, experiments, and archive/reference zones.

Reference anchors: [OO_VISION.md](docs/OO_VISION.md), [ORGANISM_MANIFEST.md](docs/ORGANISM_MANIFEST.md).

## What OO Is Not

- Not a replacement for full desktop OS ecosystems.
- Not uncontrolled autonomy.
- Not a web UI, model lab, or host process pretending to be the organism.
- Not a reason to keep complexity without owners, invariants, and tests.

## Core Architecture At A Glance

| Layer | Biological view | Engineering view | Primary path |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Cortex | Sovereign inference/runtime shell | `llm-baremetal` |
| 2 | Kernel | Execution and scheduling boundary | `kernel-baremetal`, `oo-host` |
| 3 | Circulation | Typed event bus and flow control | `united-baremetal` |
| 4 | Memory | Working/persistent continuity | `memory-baremetal`, `oo-model` |
| 5 | Reflex/vitals | Homeostasis, safety, recovery modes | `reflex-baremetal`, `vital-baremetal` |
| 6 | Senses/interface | Telemetry, ingestion, operator bridge | `network-baremetal`, `vocal-baremetal`, `yamaoo` |
| 7 | Evolution/lab | Simulation, policy, experiments | `oo-dplus`, `oo-sim`, `oo-lab`, `oo-system` |

Dual view:

- Biological view: organs, reflexes, memory, vitals, cortex, circulation.
- Engineering view: engines, modules, contracts, control planes, invariants, artifacts.

## Repository Map

| Component | Role | Language | Status | Primary path |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `llm-baremetal` | Sovereign UEFI/bare-metal runtime and cortex lane | C, scripts | Core | [llm-baremetal](llm-baremetal) |
| `oo-host` | Host twin, state orchestration, audit/replay support | Rust | Support/core-adjacent | [oo-host](oo-host) |
| `oo-dplus` | D+ language and policy experimentation | Rust | Experimental/support | [oo-dplus](oo-dplus) |
| `oo-sim` | Simulation and behavior test lane | C, scripts | Support | [oo-sim](oo-sim) |
| `oo-lab` | Experimentation and prototype lane | Multi | Support/incubation | [oo-lab](oo-lab) |
| `oo-model` | Offline model governance, data, export, validation | Python, Rust | Support | [oo-model](oo-model) |
| `oo-system` | Integration contracts, runtime specs, validation scripts | C, Python, PowerShell | Canonical support | [oo-system](oo-system) |

Reference zones:

- `llm.c`, `llama2.c`, and `llm-baremetal-github` style forks are reference or upstream zones, not automatic core dependencies.
- `yamaoo` is a host-side interface/observability lane, not a required bare-metal dependency.

## Language Direction

OO is C-first. Project-owned source should converge to at least 90% C. The remaining 10% is reserved for bounded Rust and C++ support code.

Python, TypeScript, PowerShell, and shell are support/orchestration languages only. They must not become survival-chain growth languages.

Full rules: [LANGUAGE_POLICY.md](docs/LANGUAGE_POLICY.md).

## Survival And Homeostasis First

OO evaluates survival invariants before objective execution. The vital path must continue even when cortex work, host tooling, UI, network, or experiments degrade.

Runtime modes:

- `NORMAL`: invariants green; objectives may run inside policy.
- `DEGRADED`: non-vital failure or pressure; throttle optional work and preserve continuity.
- `SAFE`: vital risk or policy uncertainty; deny high-risk actions and keep only safe subsets.
- `RECOVERY`: restore state, replay journals, verify invariants, then return to `NORMAL` only when safe.

Invariant and flow specs: [OO_HOMEOSTASIS_INVARIANTS.md](docs/OO_HOMEOSTASIS_INVARIANTS.md), [OO_CROSS_ORGAN_FLOWS.md](docs/OO_CROSS_ORGAN_FLOWS.md).

## Control Model

OO uses A+B+C control simultaneously:

- Centralized strategic control keeps mission direction, global goals, mode transitions, and policy posture coherent.
- Distributed organ autonomy lets organs perform local health checks, scheduling, and fallback inside global policy.
- Reflex/safety preemption handles threshold breaches before strategic planning completes.
- Conflict resolution principle: survival invariants first, hard policy second, optimization last.

Details: [OO_CONTROL_PLANES.md](docs/OO_CONTROL_PLANES.md).

## Quickstart

Non-disruptive path using scripts that exist in this workspace:

```powershell
# inspect current repository status
git status --short

# run the baseline bare-metal structure smoke
pwsh ./tools/scripts/smoke_baremetal.ps1 -FailOnMissing -FailOnStrictMissing

# run targeted runtime validation when working in oo-system
pwsh -NoProfile -Command "Push-Location ./oo-system; ./scripts/runtime-v1-smoke.ps1; Pop-Location"
```

Optional build path:

```powershell
pwsh ./oo-build.ps1 -SkipQemu
```

Pinned Rust toolchain:

```powershell
rustup show active-toolchain
cargo build --locked
```

Module-specific paths are documented in [oo-system/README.md](oo-system/README.md) and [llm-baremetal/README.md](llm-baremetal/README.md).

## Operator First 10 Minutes

1. Verify prerequisites for the lane you are touching: PowerShell, WSL/make/gcc where needed, pinned Rust when using Rust code.
2. Run baseline smoke: `pwsh ./tools/scripts/smoke_baremetal.ps1 -FailOnMissing -FailOnStrictMissing`.
3. Inspect vital artifacts/logs: `OO_UART.log`, `artifacts/`, module build output, and runtime validation reports.
4. Decide go/no-go before deeper runs such as QEMU, image creation, host twin replay, or yamaoo.

Do not put unstable or internal-only workflows in the first operator path.

## Safety And Policy Notice

- Policy gates apply before high-risk actions.
- Audit journals and artifacts must remain continuous enough to reconstruct decisions.
- No ungoverned high-risk actions, uncontrolled mutation, hidden network autonomy, or silent policy bypass.
- If policy is unavailable for a critical path, default to deny and move toward `SAFE`.

## Roadmap Snapshot

Phase status:

- Phase 0: doctrine freeze and module classification is documented in [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
- Phase 1: Minimal Viable OO focuses on deterministic boot, core organs, survival modes, memory journal, reflex preemption, and one telemetry path.
- Phase 2: deterministic build/test/release must remove hidden dependencies and produce reproducible artifacts.
- Phase 3: survival mode validation must prove `NORMAL`, `DEGRADED`, `SAFE`, and `RECOVERY` under fault injection.
- Phase 4+: host twin, yamaoo observability, controlled evolution, dream/swarm/model governance remain outside the vital proof until measured.

Near-term milestone: make survival/homeostasis robustness testable before expanding autonomy.

## Contribution Boundaries

- Do not perturb active development folders with broad refactors.
- Prefer additive, minimal, auditable changes.
- Keep reproducibility visible: commands, inputs, outputs, checksums, and generated artifacts must be explainable.
- Keep scripts and low-level technical docs ASCII-friendly.
- New organs, languages, or repos must identify owner, inputs, outputs, invariants, failure mode, tests, and tier.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
